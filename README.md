## Name
Google Transit Data Application

## Description
This project allows a user to import data files on transit stops, trips, routes and stop times, where they can then
search for a an attribute's ID and receive information relative to that attribute, whether it be a stop, trip, route, or stop time.
Users are also able to export any imported files to a specified directory.

## Usage
To make this program run, the user needs to have some way for your system to run Java 17.1 and display .fxml files.
To use the program, the user will need to import the data files before the can search for all the information on a stop.
For searching, the user will need to know a valid stop id to get information on the desired stop.
When the user wants to export, they can choose where ever they want the files to be exported to.
