## Name
Google Transit Data Application

## Description
This project allows a user to import data files on transit stops, trips, routes and stop times, where they can then
search for an attribute's ID and receive information relative to that attribute, whether it be a stop, trip, route, or stop time.
Users are also able to export any imported files to a specified directory.

## Usage
To run this program, the user's operating system must be capable of running Java 17.1 and compiling .fxml files.
To use the program, the user will need to import any relevant files before they can search for a specified attribute (stop, stop time, route, trip).
When searching, the user must be able to provide an attribute's ID to receive data relevant to it.
