## Name
General Transit Feed Specification

## Description
This project allows a user to import data files on transit stops, trips, routes and stop times.
The user is then able to search for a stop and get information on the trips and routes that include that stop.
A user is also able to export the imported files to where ever they lke.

## Usage
To make this program run, the user needs to have some way for your system to run Java 17.1 and display .fxml files.
To use the program, the user will need to import the data files before the can search for all the information on a stop.
For searching, the user will need to know a valid stop id to get information on the desired stop.
When the user wants to export, they can choose where ever they want the files to be exported to.
